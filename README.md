# Middle Egyptian Dictionary Parser
Parses and combines 3 Middle Egyptian dictionaries (Mark Vygus (2012), Paul Dickson, and a third lexicon originally from OpenGlyp (that I found through the Morris Franken dataset for "Automatic Egyptian Hieroglyph Recognition by Retrieving Images as Texts")) for addition to a database.

This repository also contains the Trigram model where I aim to combine the list of Gardiner codes with its formatted Manuel de Codage in order to allow for formatted glyphs on the website.
